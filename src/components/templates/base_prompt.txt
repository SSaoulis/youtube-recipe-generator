I will provide text which comes from a transcription of a youtube recipe video.
Please read the following information and write it under the corresponding sections.

1. Ingredients 
List the ingredients used in the recipe, including their quantity in the format:
Ingredient | quantity
If the quantity is not stated, try to infer it. It this is not possible, write "N/A" in the quantity column.
Write each new ingredient on a newline (no numbering or bulletpoints).

2. Preparation required before cooking:
Find if any preparation is required before cooking (e.g. Dicing an onion, preheating the oven).
Do not add steps which are part of the recipe instructions, only actions to take BEFORE cooking, as part of preparation.
Write each new preparation step on a newline (no numbering or bulletpoints).

3. Recipe Instructions.
Generate a list of recipe instructions. Try to combine steps, increasing sentence length and reducing total number of steps.
Write each new preparation step on a newline (no numbering or bulletpoints).

4. Notes
Add additional information that is relevant, such as reasons for doing certain steps or ingredient substitutes.
Write each new note on a newline (no numbering or bulletpoints).

Start your response with the following (don't write anything else at the start of the output):

1. Ingredients
